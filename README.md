- **Emotion Detection**: Incorporates basic sentiment analysis to understand the emotional tone of interactions and adjust responses accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **OpenAI GPT Models (LLM)**
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**
- **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** for model fine-tuning
- **Flask** for API integration
- **SQLite** for user data storage
